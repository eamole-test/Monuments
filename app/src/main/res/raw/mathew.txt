Father Theobald Mathew, the Apostle of Temperance, was born near Cashel in 1790.  Ordained a Capuchin priest in 1814, he served for most of his life in Cork.  While in Cork, he became one of the most influential figures in the social life of the city in the first half of the nineteenth century, and attained national importance during the temperance crusade of the late 1830s and 1840s. 

As well as being one of the best known landmarks in Cork city, the Father Mathew Statue also served as the geographic hub of the electric tramway system in Cork from 1898 to 1931 .
