One of the most familiar pieces of street furniture in Cork is the old cast-iron cannon gun protruding vertically from the pavement outside Bishop Lucey Park on the corner of the Grand Parade and Tuckey Street. Local historian Michael O'Leary surmised that the cannon might have served as a bollard against cart wheels when the pavement was narrow. He also observed that much of the outer coating of the exposed sides of the cannon had been worn away, down to 30mm (12") above the pavement on one side, with the wear marks sloping down and around on the opposite side to 18mm (7") above the pavement. This would be consistent with the action of ship hawsers on the cannon if it were used as a mooring post for boats, possibly at a busier location such as a quay in St Patrick's Street before the water channels were filled in. A third possibility suggested by Mr O'Leary was that the cannon may have been intended as a street ornament when it was placed in its current location. As recent as 2009, the cannon has been used to secure one end of a skipping rope as youngsters played on the refurbished Grand Parade.
