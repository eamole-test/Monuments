Erected in 1906 due to the fundraising of the Cork Young Ireland Society. The sculptor was John Francis Davis.

Part of the inscription reads: 

'To perpetuate the Memory of the Gallant Men
of 1798, 1803, 1848 and 1867
who fought and died in the wars of Ireland
to recover her sovereign independence
and to inspire the youth of our country 
to follow in their patriotic footsteps 
and imitate their heroic example. 
And righteous men will make our land A Nation Once Again''.
