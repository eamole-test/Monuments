The phrase 'the walled city of Cork' conjures up the familiar picture of the old city centre of Cork between the North and South Gate bridges surrounded by a permanent, unbroken wall. The actual history of the building of the walls is somewhat more complicated than this. The south island, the area known in mediaeval times as the civitas, was the first section of the city to be fortified by the Normans. Archaeologists estimate that the south island was enclosed by the early 13 th century. The wall around the south island was composed mainly of limestone. The north island, Dungarvan, was not entirely enclosed until the late 13 th or early 14 th century. The wall around the north island was composed mainly of sandstone.

Major repair work on the walls took place on a number of occasions, the final extensive rebuilding project on the walls took place in the early 17 th century. A section of the city wall is visible in present-day Bishop Lucey Park.
