The Huguenot burial ground on Carey's Lane dates back to the early 1700's with the revoking of the "Edict of Nantes 1685" and the fleeing of French protestants from France, to avoid religious persecution.

Approximately 5000 came to Ireland, and of those, 300 settled in Cork, making a significant contribution to the commercial and civic life of the city, with no less than 11 members of the Huguenot community serving as Mayors of Cork City between 1694 and 1840. 

By 1712 the Huguenot Community had established their church at Lumley Street, which soon became known as French Church Street, and in 1733 acquired the adjoining almshouse which became the Huguenot Burial Ground.

This small graveyard is still in existence. It has survived attempts to build on it. Its future now looks secure. The site was acquired by the Corporation in 2006 and reinstatement work has been carried out since. It is now enclosed but one may view it and some information panels (illuminated in dark evenings) through the locked gate in Carey's Lane.
